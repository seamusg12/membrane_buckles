# membrane_buckles

buckled_psi6.py
Takes in buckled (buckled in the x direction) 4-bead Cooke model, 
fits the buckle to a cubic spline in the X-Z plane, 
projects lipid C.O.M.'s onto the spline plane, 
calculates psi6,
computes Voronoi tesselation,
and stores a list of Voronoi areas (coarsely, without respecting PBC's.)
